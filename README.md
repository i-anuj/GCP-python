- Excited to share my recent hands-on experience with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) where I deployed a containerized Python (Flask) application using GKE Autopilot.

What I implemented:

Built a Dockerized Python Flask application

Pushed the container image to Google Artifact Registry

Deployed the app on GKE Autopilot (fully managed Kubernetes)

Configured a LoadBalancer Service to expose the application

Achieved a highly available setup with multiple running pods

- Key Highlights:

Zero node management with GKE Autopilot

Automatic scaling and optimized resource usage

Secure and production-ready deployment

Application accessible via external IP through GKE service
